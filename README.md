## Keyboard shortcuts

```
SPC  -  pause / resume
[    -  previous track
]    -  next track
```

## What about the code?

I'm still learning how to use `choo` and some other things. So feel free to [suggest improvements](https://github.com/joshwnj/choonz/issues/new), but maybe don't use this as the basis for anything serious :)
